A simple github API.
You can go to https://hogand7.github.io/CS3012--GithubAPI/visualise.html to use this API.
Enter a github username in the bax and click go to get some information about them to appear.
I began to add a visualization to the website but didn't have enough time so nothing actually shows up :(
There is code for a bubble graph and the d3 library in the repo anyway so you can take a look at that if you want.
